------TODO------
+ create master input object to import all values set by user
+ clickTag
  - convert rectangle to movie clip
  - multiple clickTags
    + create text fields that can be dynamically generated for multi-tags
+ Loop toggle
  - when action layer is first created, if loop toggle is on(default), it will
    add the loop code. If it is not on, a replay button will be placed at the end
    (might need to check with jeremy to see if there is any reason someone wouldn't
    want the replay button added)
